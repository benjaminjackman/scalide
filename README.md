n.b project is preserved for historical reasons but no longer works as it uses a pretty ancient version of Scala. It was pretty much the first thing I ever wrote in Scala and I used it primarily as a tool to bootstrap my learning of the language as Scala had pretty rough IDE support at that point in time (~2008-2009).
